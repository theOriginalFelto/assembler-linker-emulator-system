# assembler-linker-emulator-system
Assembler, linker and emulator written in C++ for an abstract, imaginary computer system.

The project is a part of a course in School of Electrical Engineering in Belgrade called System Software. The project specification is roughly translated from Serbian
and uploaded as a .pdf file in the repository (there is a Serbian version as well).

The sole program is to be run on Linux and compiled with g++, but it should also work on Windows if the same tools are used.
